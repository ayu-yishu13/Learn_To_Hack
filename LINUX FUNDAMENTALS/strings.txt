`strings` is a command that extracts readable text from binary files.

It is commonly used in CTFs, reverse engineering, and forensics to find
flags, URLs, passwords, and hidden messages inside executables.

Syntax:
strings [options] <file>

-> `-t x` - shows the offset of each string in hexadecimal.
-> `-t d` - shows the offset of each string in decimal.
